Creating a Network Storage Device

Description

As a student I worked with a fellow student to create a storage device on a network. While creating a local network with a router, the raspberyy pi became a storage device on the network. The file know as "Part 1 expiermental" was code that was used but, never fully worked. The issue with is was not being able to connect on a network as the same as my computer. The issue was resolved by installing a new operating system called open media vault. This OS function is to make the machine it is installed on to became deteacted by a network, and have its drives accessable. 

Notes:
1. A greater understanding of the hardware and the software behind how networks work, as well as how storage devices on networks can be manupilated.
2. A introudction to linuix based systems.
